# Design and UVM Verification of The SPI Master Controller 

### SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface. It is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for communication between microcontrollers, sensors, and other peripheral devices. The SPI protocol allows data to be transmitted bidirectionally between a master device and one or more slave devices over multiple data lines.

## The SPI communication typically involves four essential lines:



### 1-Master Out Slave In (MOSI): The master sends data to the slave on this line.

### 2-Master In Slave Out (MISO): The slave sends data back to the master on this line.

### 3-Serial Clock (SCK): The clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission between devices.

### 4-Slave Select (SS or CS): A line used by the master to select the particular slave device with which it wishes to communicate(not considered in our design).

### SPI is known for its simplicity, speed, and efficiency, making it a popular choice in various embedded systems and communication between components in electronic devices. 

## Please note that the design is a modified version of the one originally implemented by Nandland.
